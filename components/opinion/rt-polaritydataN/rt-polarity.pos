I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.

$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume

I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy.

The sound is great, and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others.  The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear -- this is a first (and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them).

The device works fine and I don't feel I over paid.  

Sure there are better hands free devices out there, but this one is reliable. 

My perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine.
I use the headset all day without any discomfort. I higly recommend it over the other types of headset

i helped develop the danger hiptop (aka "t-mobile sidekick) and hated holding its brick-like nature to my head ... i wanted a good headset ...

the only problem is i *hate* earbuds, so i wasn't looking forward to shopping for/buying one.  i went to the local super-electronics store, and abusing their return policy, bought one of every headset they had to try -- 23 headsets to be exact ... i picked up the jabra only to be a complete-ist, figuring there was no way i'd buy its star-trek-bugs-crawling-in-chekov's-ear styling.

but after trying them all, the jabra was *easily* the best feeling and best fitting.  

in a nutshell, here are the things i like about this unit in particular:

* it comes with 6 different fittings (3 sizes for the right and the left), so you get a chance to get a *much* closer fit than some generic ear piece.

* contrary to what others have said here, the ear pieces stay *very* snug in your ear (if they don't, you're not fitting them correctly).

* i wear glasses, so i can't tolerate over-the-ear headsets.  this, of course, is great in that way.

* i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic ear-only jabra because it:

  1. let's people know you're talking on the phone, and less likely to interrupt you while you're talking.

  2. i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise.

* it's small and easy to wrap up into my cell case.


also in the newest version, they've adding a securing "lip" to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece (this definitely was a problem before).

to top it all off, jabra's support is excellent.  i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me *three* replacements, free of charge, along with a ball point pen for my "troubles."

at 10 bucks, these things are a steal ... using one with my hiptop is a joy -- it means i can still contruct sms's, type in emails, add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone.  if you have a data device of any kind, this will make your phone experience twice as good.

a truly great product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right.  what more could you want?

thanks for reading

I think this is a pretty good earpiece...  granted, I've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's Nokia), but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort.  Where my friend's would fall out of my ear, this one (once I got it figured out) never comes loose.    Second, listening to people on my friend's, I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well, and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when I'm not using the earpiece.  Finally, when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece, she sounds distant and muffled; I've had no complaints from the people I'm talking to using the Jabra, and, in fact, my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I don't.

The ear gels are a bit hard to get used to.  They are oddly shaped (as you can see in the picture), and there are six of them total-- three of them for each ear.  Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels, while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces they've used and that they fit perfectly...  I can honesly say I've had both experiences.  When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head: *very* frustrating.  I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could, I tried holding it in place with my hand, but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands-free earpiece.  Nothing seemed to work.  I was thinking of returning it.  I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I-95.  And then one day, somehow, I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear-- with the little poky-out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal (not the fold on the top of your ear; if you do that it'll just pop out again)-- and then *voila* it stays put.  Matter o' fact, it'll stay put so well that it'll be a little bit difficult-- even *painful*-- to get out again.
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes, different patience levels, and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own.  But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out, I was golden.  I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it.
Admittedly, it is a bit difficult to get into your ear-- I'd say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly (before you're good and practiced at it), which may not sound like a lot, but it's long enough to not recognize somebody's voice or hear the first sentence they say, or whatever.  A *very mild* frustration.  But like all things good and pleasant, it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone, slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat.  In fact, I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that it's in until I go to scratch my ear or something!

The other complaint that I saw on here was that it's not compatible with Nokia phones.  In fact, it even says right on the package that it's not compatible with Nokia.  That's funny, I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine.  They make two other models of EarBoom (one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone), both of which claim to be Nokia compatible, and *neither* of those works with my phone!  Confusing?  Yes!  The problem is it doesn't work with *all* Nokia phones.  While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with, but it didn't include mine (it included one that was, numerically speaking, very close to my model: the 3590); which piqued my curiosity.  And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them.  One of them worked, the other didn't.  The strange part of it was that we couldn't see a visible difference in the two units...  and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it (that's this one, and if you look closely at the picture you can see them), while the other one (the one marked as Nokia compatible) had three.  Hmmm...  Curious.
So my advice is to either know your phone well (as in, have the little book handy) or ask for help before purchasing.

All in all 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars on performance and comfort, but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging.

Addendum:
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end...  And living in windy Providence, this is a bit of an annoyance.
Also, for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldn't hear the person on the other end of the line (and, likewise, they couldn't hear me) unless I jiggled the little jack.  This was *very *FRUSTRATING.**  Now, for some reason, I'm not having that problem anymore.  I'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom.  Either way, it's something buyers should be aware of

So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost (yeah Amazon!), but that's not why I'm writing this review.

I'd like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom.  The eargel thingies are designed quite well, of the three different sizes for each ear you're bound to find one that fits very comfortably.  Turns out I couldn't find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side.  My wife had the exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears!  I hate jogging so can't comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed.  I'd have to imagine it'd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place.

Sound quality from the earbud is decent, but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity, especially the higher frequencies.  Normally this is not a problem, but it can sometimes make the person you're talking to sound like Isaac Hayes.  The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse, without having the voices washed over with background noise.  The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving.  There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum, while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths.

I've asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive, my voice comes through loud and clear despite the boom's apparent lack of length, reinforcing my belief that size DOESN'T matter.  In fact, I have found the mic to be very sensitive to even small sounds.  Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click.  Another example, I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed!!  Yes, the mic is that sensitive.  Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears.  Not that it's obtrusive to the other person on the phone, it's just good to be aware they can hear it all.

What more to say about such a simple device. Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product.  In fact, I just ordered another - it makes a great gift

The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says Universal 2.5mm Jack  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product

I've been using my T809 since January and mostly love it.  Three main problems:  

1) There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens.  Looks like crap when the display is inactive.  I've read that other people have this problem too.  

2) I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset (they won't stay in my ears!) and because you can't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music.

3) The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume.  If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings (too quiet) and by the time I realize I'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket, I've usually missed the call.  This sucks and I don't think there's a setting to disable this "feature".

It's close to ideal, but no cigar.  Camera's great, reception's great, easy to use.  But I'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires.

BTW, if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone, make sure you see it on the bill.  I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying.   TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance, but fortunately Amazon exchanged it.


Ive always stayed away from the flip/slider phones because Im good at breaking things...Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong.  The mini sd port is awesome

The phone is great. You can check all the specs online and in other posts. You'll see that they're awesome.

From my experience...
Pros: 
- lots of features
- Slick phone... I do care about how my gadgets look like.
- camera resolution is pretty good.

Cons:
- hard to find a good case. I'm still looking for a good one. The one I got, my phone will slip out of it once in a while.
- If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it, fugget'boutit.... Althought it's not really the phone's fault, but BMW's (as I've read on other msg boards), it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW...

I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.

if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing!!! don't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that??!!! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it!!! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn;t have a chord. jeez!

Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!?

Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena.

I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike.

Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking

These are very good and not expensive.
You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.

I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!

Anybody want to trade the extras

These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping. 

The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying

I love these eargels.  My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out.  They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds.  Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them.  (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.

I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes.

I recently got this phone and love it.  T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is.  The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown.  I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades

Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome? 

If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. 

One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage

I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service! 

This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.  

Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone

I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldn't be happier. I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. I am very happy with it. T-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular

The device works fine and I don't feel I over paid.  

Sure there are better hands free devices out there, but this one is reliable.

- If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it, fugget'boutit.... Althought it's not really the phone's fault, but BMW's (as I've read on other msg boards), it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW...

I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.

$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume

I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy

The sound is great, and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others.  The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear -- this is a first (and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them).

I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.

if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing!!! don't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that??!!! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it!!! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn;t have a chord. jeez!

Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!?

Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena.

I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike.

Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking

These are very good and not expensive.
You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.

I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!

Anybody want to trade the extras

These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping. 

The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying

I love these eargels.  My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out.  They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds.  Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them.  (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.

I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes.

I recently got this phone and love it.  T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is.  The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown.  I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades

Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome? 

If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. 

One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage

I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service! 

This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.  

Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone

I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldn't be happier. I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. I am very happy with it. T-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular

Love it.  Sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel.  Some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but it's still red which is nice.  I will probably get another color on it for spring.  The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different.  Also maintains all openings for data cables etc

Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m.  Fits perfectly. 

I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking.

I keep i860 cell phone in the 'Glove all the time.  It does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone.  It fits it, after all, like a glove.

When I am taking a photo, I simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is, take the photo, and slip it back on.  

Before I used to know about this, I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way, like a wayward lock of hair.  Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary.  They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case, take photo(s), and snap it back on.  Smart.

In fact, the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half.  Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it, guys.   It's a snap!  Snaps unsnap; that is what they are for.

The glove is well named.  It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand.  I can easily pivot it around in my hand, flip it around, pick it up, and basically not expect it to skid around.  Without the 'Glove, you have a bare metal or plastic case.  Smooth looking and - well, maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars!

I like the fast release for the belt hook.  So far, it has not failed me.  I think it is at the bottom, not at the back the way some people have said, but I cannot remember for certain. I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet.

I don't use it that way much though.  The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. I easily fit it in my pocket.  With the glove on, I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily

This protects my PPC 6700 wonderfully... I've dropped it many times and this case protected it like I wanted... No scratches, nothing... Having room for the extended battery is great too, because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone

Was received in a timely manner, however, the picture online was not what I expected.  For the price, I really thought it was a little cheap looking in person.  As it was a gift, I was somewhat disappointed in the quality.  However, the person I gave it to was pleased

This headseat is pretty neat when you're on the road or just relaxing between work.  It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pause/play and answer/hangup features.  The comfort of the ear budds could be a little better, but the stereo sound is great

Fast service, good price. Look forward to future business dealings.

This is a great product. The only area of improvement would be the belt clip. It is very difficult to attach to the belt. Over all it is a great case

I Really like this phone, the camera quality, the software, everything is excellent

This is really cool phone and has many features. Unfortunately, you could not use some of these features in the U.S. One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price. Its price is just 429.99 on the Nokia's web page.
The phone gets 5 stars but the retailer's price gets -2 stars.

I will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned.Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear

Just received it this week.  Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model, the photos are much better (both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses, but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the N90).  Also, the N73 covers all radio bands, making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae).  The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular, so depending on the city I was in, I occasionally had very spotty coverage.  The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90, and best of all, it is much more compact than the N90, fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket.  Last, there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone, protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?).  As usual, the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera, but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds. 

If you don't use this phone, it costs $3/month.  Normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute, which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost.  Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when I'm in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing.  I don't use cell phones much, but if I must have one, I might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill.  For kids who think they can mangle the budget, forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo.  Once they use up the card, the only number they can dial is 911, but that's it.  Bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day.  At some point, I might not be able to live without this. 

These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.   

 I was completely satisfied with the phone clip I purchased. It`s sturdy and well constructed. I would recommend it.I will use this site again

I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. THE FEATURES ARE SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THIS PHONE IS A NET 10 WIRELESS PHONE. NET 10 WIRELESS IS A SUBSIDIARY OF TRACFONE.  I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE. I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON [...] ITS A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN CALLING

I've been using this phone with the Net10 service since March, and have to say I am very happy with it.  Coverage areas have been great.
I don't use a cell phone very often, so this was the most economical way for me to go. Although the phone doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have....it gets the job done

I have not had any problems with this phone.I dont use it for long periods at a time ...only in the car and for text.Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER.I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare...so its great for me.I got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper.Overall,I would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week

I like this little flip phone.  The service has been good and the features are easy to use.  The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phone will last.  The flip part is a little weak, but we will have to see.  It was really easy to add minutes, and you can do it right from your Net10 phone

The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color

This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  

As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  

The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow

After buying the new LG Chocolate, I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it. I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value. So far, it's worked just like it should

When I first got this, it did not look like it was big enough for my phone, but as soon as I opened the package and put my phone in it I could tell it was a perfect fit. I really like the clear window, which I did not have on my previous case, now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time

This is the best bluetooth I have used. Wind noice no problem, user friendly coustomer support for Cardo is great . I have 5 co worker who has order the headset. Just a great product. Great pric

My only complaint, and consequently the 4-star rating, is that sometimes I don't hear the Blackberry or feel the vibration. Apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the OEM plastic holster

This is a great way to carry the blackberry.  It also keeps it protected.  I would recommend this product

Provides great protection for the Treo,
but does add a noticeable amount of thickness,
making it more of a bundle

Overall, I like it.  The best part is the flip up screen protector.  I have had 2 Zire models and managed to break both screens.  My dislike is that I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting.  I have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again, to no avail.  As for the SD card issue, I remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject. To keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo, I drilled a hole in the back, right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes

The skin is very useful, but can be improved on ways to put it on and take it off

I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Treo 650 so I can "stay in touch", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome!

No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Treo 650 Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product. 

A must have for anyone who owns a Treo 650. I also see they have these for the Blackberries

Iam very pleased with this item, I purchased it for my son

I made the mistake of ordering a $7.00 battery and I thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting. I replaced my new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ. So word to the wise... Just get this battery and you will not have my problems. Well worth it

This item works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack.  The sound quality is exceptional.  The only problem is that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to fall off

When I bought my Motorola V220, my Cingular Store charged top dollar for the car charger - and they were sold out. I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon.  The car charger is compatible with the V220, and it comes with case and hands-free ear bud - all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone.  The ear bud does not have the best sound - voices come across as somewhat muffled, though still audible - and the case is adequate.  I wouldn't buy this set specifically for those items, although they both work with/fit the V220.  As I see it, they were bonuses for purchasing the charger.

Five stars for the charger, three for the rest

This item was easy to find, purchase and use. Saved us several dollars as well. A true win-win. Thanks

The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy.  The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TX--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX.  For some reason, the cable won't let me charge using the USB wall-charger I got for my wife's iPod, but it does charge the TX off my computer's USB port (which is a Powerbook G4--notorious for being underpowered)

Great reception, great volume controls, easy to use... I have the blue, my husband, the black... To the reviewer who said, "too thin" - well, don't get the thin phone then... Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra (plug in) - even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones... which other phone would most likely make you buy.  We're in our late 20s/early 30s - and just dig the phone.  Fits perfect in a small purse or wallet.  

One issue DH has -- the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into (bottom of the phone) and when he is on speaker phone, he tends to hold it there, and it sometimes can make your bars go down.  That is it, and all you have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone

I really like this phone..  its cute, its little, its perfect for a young woman.  I had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't an mp3 player (i have an ipod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a pda (i have a palm tx)... its just simple and cute.

its bluetooth compatible... although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth, but i'm not sure if its the headset or the phone..

**the ringer on it is SUPER quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse.  i'm grown accustomed to "listening" for the vibrate feature instead.

i like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list.  

i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable.

sound quality is good, on both ends

i dig it.  im sure you will too

I have trouble to buy from Bestbuy, but I ordered it from amazon, cheapest price and good product! Thanks

The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from Scratches, it fits like a glove , really nice , the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked  after 5 days of use, it wasn't hit or treated carelessly. I'll order some more because they are really cheap and  it's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone.Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition, the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it.

Got this to protect my Motorola L6 phone.  It fits the phone like a glove.  I also love that it protects the phone screen.  The only complaint is that the case open easily if it's dropped or handled in a rough way.  Clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that.  My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it. The case still does not have a chip or crack on it

A perfect fit for my L6. I love the protection for the screen....it covers all of it so you don't need those plastic screen covers. Don't be afraid if you drop your phone... because it's protected

I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and they last about six-twelve months.  I bought this one and it is much more solid of construction, shorter cord, and a better angle to the power adapter.  i bought two of these for less than the cost of one from Sprint.  My wife carries her's in her purse, while I just keep mine in my car.  This is the best car charger for the Treo and I have had Treo's for about 6 years

fits the cell phone well and seems secure. i like the catch that holds it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow

I recommend this phone to ANYBODY.  I absolutely love it.  I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far.  The music player is great, and I swear...the camera looks ALOT better than 1.3 mega pixel.  The handset is wonderful, and so is the headset included with it.  If you buy this phone, it WILL last you a long time.  

But yeah..so far, no problems whatsoever.  I love it. [..

I am in love...with my phone!  I know that sounds absurd, but it's true.  Originally, I had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting this one; seeing how I had already done so with the Motorola V3T.  

Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorola's V3T RAZR handsets (both for having them freeze at startup), I called customer service and told 'em I wanted this handset instead.  With a minor contract extension/handset upgrade, I was glad I made the switch to NOKIA.  I've only had it for 24 hours and I'm totally satisfied with it.  Below is a list of "pro's and con's" for you to consider:

Pros:
- Bright and visible LCD screen.
- MP3-ringtones enabled (make sure to cut your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so).
- Video ringers.
- Pretty fast charge, even while messing around with it.
- Bluetooth and infrared-enabled making for quick file transfers.
- Dialing keypad is raised for easy input.
- Date can be enabled on screen (which the V3T lacks).
- Comes with "headphone jack adapter" which enables use of any standard headphone that you may have.

Cons:
- Vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges (by default).
- Power button is somewhat small and difficult to execute.
- FM radio plays with static (this may varies by area).

As you can see, the pro's outweight the con's with this one, so give it at try.  Also, if you decide that it's not for you, return it to T-Mobile within 14 business days of your purchase and get a full refund.  As for me, I won't returning it because it's definitely a keeper!  :

I purchased this phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed. I haven't used all the functions yet (downloading music), but haven't had any problems with anything else. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros
1-Colorful/Clear Display
2-Good Volume (ringer volume is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine)
3-Easy Menu Navigation

Cons
1-No shortcut to get to main menu (have to keep pressing "back" button)
2-Battery access (it's really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and SIM card-could be a good thing though)
3-On/Off Button (it's very small-basically have to use my fingernail)


I got a chance to play with one of these last week. The external speaker is very loud, the controls are easy to use and best of all, it comes with a 1GB card. My only gripe is the slide feels a little loose; I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake. All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capability/software is a lot better than my KRZR

I purchased this Nokia 5300 Black at the T-Mobile store. It does come with 1 GB memory card and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems. Phone comes with USB cable to connect to your computer. I have a Mac so this was easy to do. You will not be able to download songs bought from iTunes but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4. You can hold up to 500 songs if they are all 3.5 minutes long and compressed to 128 kps. My music is usually remixed and/or longer than 3.5 minutes each.

I wasn't able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook but I was able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car. Apple has not approved the Nokia 5300 yet to sync. I am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new.

Overall, I love the feel of this phone, has wonderful 2 in screen, color is great, camera is cool, and it is very intuitive to use. 

I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia. However, the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned. 

Once you load up your songs, the speaker is impressive. This morning, I had the phone playing music in one part of the house, and I had to go get something at the other end of the house, and I could still hear the music perfectly.

Calling on the phone was better than expected. I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of people/background noise and I was able to carry on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my Samsung that was difficult to do this with.

The phone is quite sturdy. And I am happy to have a phone that not everyone has - a Motorola Razor. This Nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but I feel like I have a very unique phone that is more than a phone. 

Who needs an iPod mini when you can get this and your phone all in one?

I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone. There is very little to chose from at the T-Mobile store as far as accessories and Nokia.com didn't have much either.

*****

The alarm feature to wake up is cool too. You can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm. It also comes with programmable snooze. What a dream!

*****

You can make calls without even having to slide the phone to dial. As long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book, then all you have to do is look up and press the green button! 

*****

When you are playing your music, if an incoming call comes in, it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in. Once you are done with the phone call, you can resume playing your music.

*****

As I said, this phone is a gem in all areas - speaker, sturdy, colorful, I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing, call quality is great even in loud areas, and lots of little creature comforts.

Definitely consider this phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone. Else, this may not be the phone for you

I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part. The first thing you'll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is.  This is a slider phone, and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys. The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number that's not in your contacts and to text message. 

Next, we go to the features.  So we got a 1.3MP camera, camcorder, music player, 1GB microSD card, bluetooth support, and infrared port..and *drumroll please* an FM radio.  Now, the FM radio isn't satellite based, so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the U.S., just those stations local to you.

Now I will go into the good and bad things about each feature:

1.  Camera - Impressive picture quality. Yes it's only 1.3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras, but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does? 5/5

2.  Camcorder - Not all that impressive.  While you are recording, the quality seems perfect.  However, once you play it, it turns a bit distorted.  Plus, it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card. 3/5

3.  Music Player - Impressive.  The speaker is of good quality, and very loud.  However, I still could not find a way to change the order of the songs without making a playlist.  There's play, pause, next song, previous song, fast forward, and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures. The buttons must be pressed fairly hard, so your music won't start playing spontaneously in your pocket. Also, I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds. 4/5

4. FM Radio - I bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement.  Well, the truth is you don't need to buy anything extra.  Just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone, and this will serve as an 'antenna' and will allow you to hear stations. And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio, yes the sound will go to the earbuds. However, there's a 'loudspeaker' option that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker, but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in, as it serves as the 'antenna'.  This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone, you NEED to have the earbuds with you. You may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna (or you may have to move) in order to get clear reception. 3/5

Misc. Info:

Only two games to included, and both trials. (Lumines, Texas Hold'em)

You can't transfer games from another phone. You must pay and download them again.

You can't delete the pre-created profiles (those that come with the phone). You can just create your own.

In order to change the phone to vibrate, you must make a vibrating profile. Then to use it, it takes several steps, which is not hard, but inconvenient.  

The interface shows the month and date, but not the day of the week.

Only two face templates included with the phone.

That's all for now.

Overall: 4/

I'm quite happy with this car charger.  It's much faster than the old one I used for an earlier Ericsson CF388.  Quite simply, it does what is supposed to

Good product - the retractable chord feature is great and keeps the car clutter free.  Works well

I've owned and discarded numerous chargers.  This one is great - the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use.  It looks pretty fragile, but so far it's held up to pretty heavy use.  Many of the other chargers I've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection - no such problems with this one

Easy to snap on and it wont come off easy like others.  Protects well and does not hinder any functions

Don't go without an extra cell phone battery.  This is the one you want if you don't like the bulky one

this product needs a better custom fit. It slides around too much it needs a smaller fit it is too big

I have a baby pink Razr, and this skin looks so good over it. Also it really adds grip, so it's not as easy to drop, and the silicone stays warm in cold weather, unlike the bare metal of the razr. I would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr, they are awesome

This cover is great, it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped. It isn't soft leather so if you want to protect your RAZR you might want to consider a shield

I think it will do a good job of protecting my phone in case I drop it

This Razr phone cover is a great product.  Hard shell protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable.  Easy access to side buttons...protection on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover I've seen for this phone....keeps keys and screen open so no dust gets pushed up against them....overall a good product for the money

The cord appeared to be pretty messy. But the product is just fine. 

-Good quality sound.
-Accept/Hang calls.
-Volume control.

I don't think I want more. The connector is a Pop-port connector. It's showed just as big in the product's image. If you have a 2.5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image, then what the h... is wrong with you?

this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky. come with belt clip if u need i

great product, exactly as advertised... thinking about buying a couple more in different color

I am very happy with the phone case, there are alot of cases available, this is by far the best in my opinion

Wow, I have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever. Clear sound-great range-and most of all its gorgeous. Turns heads all over the place. Man I feel high tech with this thing on. I payed $30.00 off of ebay, but that was a rare deal. Still Amazons price cannot be beat. Buy it, youll love it

Got it for 20 bucks on cyber moday. Easy to configure and use. Nice sound quality. Only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly

This is a great product.  It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it.  It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size

Crystal clear sound along with being very comfortable and user friendly make this headset a great cell phone accessory to have!  Love it!!  Amazon's price couldn't be beat.  Very happy with it!

+comfortable
+easy to put on
+fair-to-good sound quality
+full charge lasts approximately 2-3 weeks
+fully compatible with Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR
+nice style with black and "alloy" accents

-some callers claim to hear echoing
-not the best sound quality (I like Logitech better

I had a motorola H300 before... and this is leaps and bounds better. 
The sound quality in both units are great but I'm impressed by the weight of this LG unit. It is like comparing stones to feathers (a bit exagerated but you get the point...). 
This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud, which sits snuggly in my ear. The Motorola unit didn't... which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls. That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my head a bit to keep the unit against my ear. With the new LG, I no longer have to look like I have a stiff neck while I'm driving

 This item came with the other item I ordered at the same time. It's quality is good, but does not stay on the phone, when opened, as well as I would have liked

The title says it all: Fits Great, Great Price! Real leather and fits like a glove

This product is a good deal if you know how to use it. Unfortunately, if you are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider. The Verizon V=cast product would be better because it comes with Headphones. If you already have the headphones (which cost anywhere from $20-$100) than this product will be good for you

It fits great but doesn't cover the corners of the phone... kinda the point of a case.  The seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful.  The bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip you're stuck with it sticking out in your pocket. 

I am using this as a spare, so haven't actually put it in the phone yet.
I will definately take it on vacation with me.

i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me), and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires.  and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40!  so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat, and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing.  the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it, my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device.  i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why.  it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more.  so the connector part could be a little sturdier, that's all

Use it every day, it's a nice connector that does just what it says it does.  As with all Treo/Palm connectors, you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection.  Wiggling the connector where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to work for me

This is the correct cable for the Tungsten E2. It's not listed in the product description but you can find the info on zip-linq's web site. I've had several of these for other devices. Great products

The product works very well, but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone. Overall, I would recommend it if the user pays attention when connecting. Great buy for the price

This is a nice cellphone.  I got it from a local cellphone shop.  Free and only 1 year contract.  Eventually prices will be free like the motorola Razor V3.  Small phone and I like the mp3 player mode :

This is the best phone I have ever had.  Reception is crystal clear, and it is also a mp3 player, with the ablility to add a memory card. Video, and voice recording capabilities, and a 8x zoom camera. And best of all very, very user friendly. 

I was expecting just to save the touch-screen from scratches, but these screens make the touch-screen also "feel" better.

There was no loss of brightness with the screen.

Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough.

Its a pack of 15 screens.  Have been using just the first one for the past three months, and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all I'll need to replace it

This holster holds the V220 securely in place.  The only problem might be that it is hard to pull it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone.

This is a good holster for my V220. It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be, so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is, it adds a little wear to that area. Other than that its a good holster for the price. And thats another one of my problems. I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall, which was highly over priced for my standards. Amazon seems like a great place to buy it, but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories, then you can find a site with free shipping for it, and its 7 bucks. Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks, but with shipping. I trust amazons shipping though. So if you want a functional holster, get this one

I have had this phone (and Virgin Mobile pay as you go service) for only a day or two, but I wanted to write this review before I forget. I'll update it if I change my mind.

Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in, it's a good ride. The phone resembles a small remote control. It's sleek and unassuming. Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screen, but it's a pleasant experience. The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation. 

It's attractive. It works. It seems a real no-brainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service. You can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuff--but you'll have to get used to the funny graphics.

The UI is totally intuitive. You interact with the menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if you've been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences. 

One thing: this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine (thirties). While it's a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing (pay as you go--for me 18c/min), there's a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel. I have Lily Tomlin's operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds; and if I should ever receive a text message, among my canned response options (that come standard with the phone) are "Hell no," "Can't talk," and "Leave me alone."

My friend has had one for a few months and loves his. He makes a good bit more money than I and sports some fancy handheld devices, so it's not just that it's so cheap and cool.



I'm a long-running Virgin customer, but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry, and so I've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier (including non-US). Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.

Let's start with the positives:

-Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.

-For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.

-Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors. 

-Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage). 

-UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.

-Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.

-Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...

-Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).

On the downside:

-Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).

-Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.

-No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.

-No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.

Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that

I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewer--if you want a phone-phone (without all the extra hoopla) this isn't a bad deal.  I "*bought" a red Slice a couple of weeks ago (take note that I'm not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear) and for my needs (emergencies, quick calls to family from the grocery store) it's just right.  

Good points:

I got mine for "*free" with Reward Zone points at Best Buy.

Fits into a small purse or pocket easily.

Nice looking (someone mistook it for a "Chocolate" the other day).

Clear reception (long distance calls are just as crystal as local; not sure if this is an "area" thing, but apparently the service in and around Chicago's solid).

Pay-as-you-go option works well for someone who doesn't spend a lot of time on the phone.

My Slice holds a charge just fine (I've noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem, but so far, so good) and doesn't heat up, as someone else mentioned (maybe that reviewer's got a defective phone or battery?).

Not so good points:

It's so slim my husband has bet me I'll lose the phone within a couple of months (could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk).

Someone else mentioned the odd graphics (hot dog dripping blue sauce, some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth.  Seriously, I have no idea what those things might be), but I say it's workable if you have a sense of humor (:

Yes, the buttons are small.  I have small hands, slender fingers, and I still manage to bump the "3" whenever I'm trying to shut off the phone.

Sometimes it's difficult to turn on (the button doesn't always respond when I push it, though could be I'm a wimp), but once it's on it's fine. I'm thinking this will get broken in with more use.

All in all, it's not a bad phone.  Beautiful red.  I find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty (phone confessions!).

I'm satisfied with mine.  And since I haven't forked out hundreds of dollars--or any dollars, really--I won't feel too guilty when/if I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork! 

I got my Slicer past black Friday for $19 from Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency. The Virgin plan 18 c/min pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they were originally made to do.
First $20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 months (one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active) despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30c/min to Eastern Europe. I used the phone on my business trip to call home. The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phone so far. The Virgin web site is excellent. The account is easy to recharge. They also have planty of ring tones and graphic options 
for downloading (mostly priced about $2 per download).

The phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuff except a camera.
However the memory is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for $19. I am surprised to hear that other people complained about the battery life. My phone holds charge about 3-4 days on stand by. 

The only bad thing I discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone (for example during the flight) I had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again.

I would sincerely recommend the phone and the Virgin pay as you go plan to mature users

As a basic phone, the Slice rates OK. I have only a few minor complaints. 1) When a headset is attached the phone does not ring through the external speaker. So if you are not wearing the headset when a call comes in. The call will be missed. 2) There is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time. It can vibrate or it can ring. 3) The battery life is not as good as stated. In Standby the phone runs out of power after about six hours. 4) With text messaging there is no Reply option. To reply to a text you have to start a new message and then search for the sender of the original message. 5) The ring tones that come with the phone are horrible. Aside from those few problems I have been quite satisfied with the phone

Two week review
I got this phone to use as a phone and am very happy with it. I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review.

First, the qualifier. I have a nice canon camera and don't want to use my phone to take pictures. I don't want to use my phone to listen to music or surf the internet either, I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there. If you are one of those people that has a different agenda for your phone, then this is probably not the phone for you.

The Good
Size is great. This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width, but shorter. It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky.  It makes a razr feel thick, but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvr. 

The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phone. It also has good reception. Sprints network is not the best in my area, but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar.

When I was in the car, the road noise got too loud to hear, but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine, and keep my hands on the wheel. 

Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lot. I expect to spend between $150 and $200 this first year, including the $50 up front for the phone. The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included. Although I haven't tried them, it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level.

Many of the other Virgin phones look like toys. Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it, it also looks like a real piece of equipment. As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP. (in vibrate mode of course) At the same time, my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool.

The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu. What were they smoking when they decided to use a pig for "my account," a dragon for "messaging," etc. Other than that, the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive. 

Can't really comment on reliability on this phone after just two weeks, but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine.

The Bad
Perhaps because they are affordable in other ways, Virgin screws you on ringtones and background. The four ringtones included are unacceptable, and you are blocked from up or down loading your own. They do have a pretty big collection on their website you can get for $2.50 a pop, but none of them sound like a phone.  The included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too, so you are likely to fork out $2.00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well. 

The buttons are a little too small. Most of the time I do fine, but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small. Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I haven't run into that problem any more. 

Battery life has not lived up to what I read, but that might be because of how I use it. If I charge it every night I am fine. I ordered an extra charger to keep in the office and one for the car as well just in case.

Summary
After two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls. It is not big on extras like a camera, but what it does it does well. Virgin uses Sprint's network, see if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a Virgin phone. [...

I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now. I've used it for 3 years and really like it's basic functionality. The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and that's pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have low-battery life. I'm hoping it'll last for 2 more years before I get a new phone to catch up with the modern world


Saves time and $$ up/downloading pics  tunes to/from my phone.

The Speck rubber case is the best case i've found for my Blackberry 7290.  That being said, it's not ideal and i'd make a few changes.

Pros -- protects case well; no screen scratches; minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag; no need to use the belt clip (most women prefer purses/totebags to belt clips!); and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages (no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag). 

Cons -- clear case collects dirt; screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight; screen cover doesn't fit squarely into the rubber case; and screen cover gets scratches on it, making the screen harder to read.  

I get a lot of compliments on this case, it's different enough to be noticed, and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case.  However, because of the cons, I suspect i'll need to replace this case more than once a year.  But i like it enough that i'll pay the $35 to do so.  Maybe the next version will have some improvements.  In the meantime, i feel like i'm getting my money's worth out of it.

I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can "stay in touch", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome!

No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Blackberry Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product. 

A must have for anyone who owns a Blackberry. I also see they have these for the Treos

THIS COVER IS SO HOT I GET TONS OF COMPLEMENTS ON IT IT'S A GREAT COLOR AND THE SCREEN PROTECTOR HELPS A LOT TOO. I WOULD DEFFINETLEY RECOMEND THIS TO ANY ONE

This case is superior. It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed). The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip. It's bulky and impractical. Just a simple tension clip would have been fine

I have had this for 2 months now, and it has worked out well. I use it on my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercise, I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone. When a call comes, the AudiblePlayer pauses, and I can answer the phone with the built-in button. Voice quality is fine on my end (in both ears) and I have received no complaints from the other end, unlike the other reviewer (maybe he got a bad unit, or his stereo connector is dirty?). When the call is over, the AudiblePlayer resumes. I never have to stop my exercise, or even slow down! My only complaint is that the volume control doesn't work worth beans. When you rotate it, at various positions, you will hear from one ear or the other. There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears; but, that is not at the maximum volume. This is a bit annoying, but something I can live with. I just leave it at one position (close to the max volume, but a little less), and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume

It is so flexible and high quality sound/volume control 

Just plug in a headset of your choice and you can:

* listen to music on your Treo 650 
* Headsets sound awesome on it
* It will automatically shut off the music when the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headset still ON
* Has an awesome volume control 
* Works with any headset and you can hear it in BOTH ears by the way
* I keep my headphones on while on treo cell phone calls because it has a BUILT in Mic which is perfect.  no one can even tell I am on a headset
* I have a stressful job and listening to music while I am working in my home office with headset and the ability to pick up calls and leave my headset on with microphone is REALLY GREAT

BUY THIS NOW - your quality of life will increase

I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. I have dropped it many times- still works.  In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants, I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what- IT WORKS.  I am still using it as it works perfectly - even the camera.

I used my sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it.  The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable.  I will be keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives

This Samsung is the most reliable phone I've ever had. I've had it for two years, dropped it NUMEROUS times, and it is still going strong with only a few scratches. The battery life has declined during this period of time, but it still lasts about two days before charging. While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now, I am impressed with how many applications I use daily - alarm clock, scheduler, memo pad, etc. Reception is usually good too. 
In all honesty though, the camera is not terribly great. Pictures tend to have a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry. I still enjoy the camera, if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options (black and white, brightness, flash, etc.) to make pictures look decent. The video option is rather lame though, as the footage is choppy and you can't even transfer or send it to anything.
Recently when I was on a shuttle, two girls, both with Razors, saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well. Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones. I am supposed to be getting a new phone too, but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up. If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone, this is a good one

Almost 2 years ago, my fiance and I signed up for a 2-year contract with Verizon. We got a great deal for both phones. And two years later, both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents. This is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily. I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone. 

Pros:
 - Sturdy: It's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin        phones. I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition. Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone, the battery doesn't detach easily. Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson, the battery would also detach and I'd have to restart my phone.
 - Compact: Though it is on the thicker side, this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it. 
 - Good Buttons: For those who text message a lot, the way the buttons feel can really make a difference. The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting.
 - Menu  short cuts: On the side of the phone, you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow. If you hold #, your phone goes into vibrate mode. If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera  video menu pop up. You can also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press "up," I have mine set on the calendar. 
 - Long battery life: I'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone, but for every day use, this phone is great with respect to its battery life. There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged.
 - Camera has flash  other neat options: You can also adjust the brightness level, have a self timer, take multiple shots, 10 different "fun frames," and 5 different colortones like sepia, monochrome (black  white and negative. 
 - Zoom: You can zoom upto X4. 
 - Phonebook: Contacts are easy to access and it's easy to search for entries. I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one name. You can enter that persons home, mobile, fax, office and pager number. You can also enter an alias and email address. You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups.
 - Voice commands:By pressing  holding the * button, a voice command menu appears. It's a nice feature but is not something I often use.
 - Speed dailing: One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing. It's nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person.
 - Menu styles: There are 2 different menu styles you can use. I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through. My fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design.
 - Custom welcome and goodbye screen.

Cons:
 - Video quality is poor and very pixelated. My phone only holds 2 15-second videos.
 - Despite the generous 15 ring tones, it's hard finding a ringtone that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. Out of the 15 ring tones, there are only about 2 decent ring tones.
 - Antenna: I don't use the antenna very often but when I do, it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy.
 - Picture quality is not the best. If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone.
 - Does not have V-Cast.
 - No MP3 player.

Overall: This cell phone is exactly that, a cell phone to make calls. It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone.

this phone is great. It was my first phone ever and when it came time to get a new one i just couldnt find a phone as great as this one. So if your looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anything cause let me tell you mine went through world war 3 and its still working like new and not to mention the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in time if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect:) i was and still am real pleased with this phone and it is an excellent phone for anyone!!!!!!!!:

If you're hard on your electronics (like I am) this phone is for you. It's practically indestructible. I put mine through the washing cycle (as in washing machine, yes) three times, let it dry overnight, and it still works perfectly. I've also run it through the dryer twice, dropped it countless times, thrown it at a wall, and ran over it on a mountain bike. The camera still works, and I think the reception actually got BETTER after going through the washer. All it has is some scratches on the casing and a bent antenna. This is a perfect phone for a on-the-go, klutzy person

This phone is great!!! I love this phone. I have had no problems with this phone at all. The camera is pretty good, and it's small and cute in size, and it has good reception. I would definitely reccomend this phone!!

This Similar Unit is 1/4th the Cost of the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300, and it is JUST AS GOOD.

Verizon Sells it for $19.99 + Tax

Amazon Vendor Sells it for $.01 + $4.99 Shipping

Bottom line, it is just a Piece of Plastic that gets the Job don

My daugher loves this one

I've had my snap-on case for about a month and I love it. The magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone.The bottom case could fit a little more snugly, but it's not a problem

Fits great My Wife likes the bright color as it is easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone

We got this phone for my sister's new razor. The color and fit were great! I was worried since it was a phone from Altell but it fit like a glove! Thanks

If you have a cell phone, you need a charger.  You don't have to get a car charger, but it's a good idea, if you have a car.  This works well

This is a very nice case. It fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it. I found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit.

A great case that I would highly recommend.  

No comment. Everything is OK !
Regards,
Cristia

It snapped right on, and looks great.  But sometimes it can slip and press the buttons on the side of your phone.  It can either make the phone not work, or run down the battery

First of all fast shipping and second of all what a great product it is! I absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees it! Thanks

Quality of this product was excellent.  I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover.  Would recomment this to anyone.  I have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it.  Only one complaint, the clip is not tight enough on my belt, would recommend a little tighter.  Overall, the best I have ever seen.  The stitches are even and tight, good quality

This case is well equiped the handle wearing it on belt, at worl, plays movies etc. easily access  good looking! It functions at any level. Shop at Amazon for all your Motorola Needs!

The case fits like a glove!  Appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching.  The cover and back were easy to attach and did not scratch my phone, which I checked by removing the case. 

My only complaint was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt. The attachment kept my phone from laying flat.  No problem, if you slide off the back cover, and take off the small foam piece on the inside, you will see a tiny screw.  Just unscrew and remove the mount.  There will be a hole in your cover; if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece. Attach the back cover to the phone and then fill in the hole with a piece of felt.  Looks fantastic. 

If you are a clip user, the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it. But maybe that is a good thing so that it won't fall off accidentally.

I cannot comment on how well the case will wear since I have only had a few days.  

My friends that have seen it love the new look.  I chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone.  Awesome!!

This was a great price for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery. The only thing I don't like is the lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around. All in all this was a great deal

The battery works great and lasts a long time. I'd give it 5 stars if not for the cheezy cover; it falls off sometimes

I like the shape of the plug so that it doesn't cover up any other outlets. It works, what else can I say

This is a great basic cell phone. I bought one and received another as a gift. Unfortunately, I opened both so now I have (2). If anyone needs one for twenty-five plus shipping that has not been registered with Net10 (still has bonus 300 minutes and no number), is new, and has all original accessories (open package); or for ten extra you can get an OEM car charger, leather case, and earphone (all unused), please email movieshop(at)hotmail(dot)com 

I've had TracFone service for 2 days now and glad I switched.  The C139 is small compact and fits in my shirt pocket.  It lacks in ring tones and the address book could be better but for a simple phone, it's all I need. I don't need the internet access and all the other features I end paying for and not using.  TracFone was quick to transfer my phone number which happened in 1 day and they said it would take 7 days. I'm impressed with their service so far. I won't go back to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in on a service agreement for 2 years.  I have good service and will be saving $300+ a year now.  If you want a nice small light and simple phone that all you want to do is make and receive phone calls, this is the one

For the $50 bucks you pay here, you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime.  That's not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere, it would be $20 bucks, and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately $20 some odd bucks or so.  Plus tax. So cost works about to be about the same.  Frankly, I see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere. 

Regarding the sim card, I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion.  A sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD -electro static discharge- just like computer RAM is.  ESD is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed.  I'd bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows.  Before you handle the sim card, you should "ground" yourself by touching something metal.  Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD.

The phone itself is OK.  It's BASIC.  Emphasis on the basic.    I just transferred my mobile # from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139, about the only edge the c139 has over the V120c is the color display.  Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper.  IMO, Motorola could have added a port to accomodate a USB interface to this model.  It was short-sighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c -also in the same price range- has such a port.  

Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time.  I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday (10/28/06) and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone.  Also, it is an entirely new network.  In Southern California, the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular.  

Suffice it to say, I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly, however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesn't recognize my number and to input my voicemail number. And around and around it goes.  I anticipate nothing but problems with "technical support" when I contact them.  They are very polite as customer service reps, however they can barely speak or understand English.  I am envisioning hours of BS with the call I have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever. Note to Tracfone:  Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT.  

Also, I wasn't overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging.  The V120c is actually more intuitive. It's much easier to use.  But the c139 does have one advantage in this regard - text messages cost only 0.3 units versus on the V120c, TracFone was deducting 0.5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message.  I'm not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone.  It should be one uniform deduction across the board.  Consumers should contact TracFone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon.

Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone and wants an *inexpensive* phone with a much easier on the eyes color display.  Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for $20 bucks.  But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper, and a little more flexibility, then get yourself a Nokia 2126. For the same money you spend here, the Nokia is a better phone.  It has a USB port, a speakerphone, plus other extras.  And you probably won't have any trouble setting up the voicemail either.

My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thank you

My tracfone has worked out good so far. Customer service is fine and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use. If you decide to get a tracfone, please email me for a quick referral before activating it- we each will get 100 free minutes from the 'refer a friend' program. I'll also send you the simple instructions to follow. I've used Tracfone for quite a while, so i should be able to answer any questions you might have. 
ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should be able to get us the free minutes

My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thanks 

I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great. I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good. I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces. This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good. i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine.

Are we all talking about the same phone here? I haven't had any problems with it and using it is a breaze. I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plan so I wouldn't get stuck with roaming charges while I was away, far from my calling area. My old phone (also an LG) wasn't compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old AT service. I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for. I also like the fact that it has a speakerphone. It does not have a camera, and I was not looking for one. I already own three very good stand alone cameras, why bother with another?? I was although a little aggravated having to re-enter all of my old phone book information because that's the only way you can do it. The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic.

After two no-brand aftermarket cables which were invisible to the phone and Nokia Phone Suite, this cable and the included software driver worked perfectly. (Note: Nokia Phone Suite must be separately downloaded, but is free of charge.)

We have uploaded photographs from our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone.

Nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cable. I recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone. Some Motorola phones accept a universal mini-USB cable which I believe is cheaper

The pack is quite as described.  Any one of the three items
might justify the small expense

Good purchase.  Although I have not used the headset yet, the case and charger work perfectly.  Great savings.  Amazon is the place to shop for a discount

Be careful - Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz.  It is not.  Read the 'Vital Statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz.  Check the Sony web page (and other people who sell this phone) and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz.

I don't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy.  I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case - I have no idea if this phone is really good or not

I love this phone.  I can do so much with it.  It is light weight and fun to carry.  I love the button flip feature.  Great phone!!

Purchased this phone a little over a month ago and so far everything works well and have no problems.  Many nice features and the service in the state of GA is good

I bought this phone as part of the Sprint/Nextel SERO plan.

I used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didn't fit my needs for several reasons outlined below:

- Battery life was sporadic -- I got maybe a day worth of power from it. One time it completely discharged overnight. For the price of the phone (and the two year contract it carries) this is a dealbreaker.

- The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area (I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years - so I have some experience with coverage around town). I was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals.

- The phone would sporadically mute the ringer. An incoming call would light up the display but there would be no ringing. This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring.

- For the same monthly service fee, I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet ability. Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen -- but if I'm going to be locked into a 2 year contract I would like to have some fast internet access on the phone. The i880 still uses the slow Nextel data network.

I was not a Direct Connect/Walkie Talkie user. If I were, then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher (since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network). I could not justify being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed sub-par on a network that did not (and likely never will) support the latest high speed technologies.

Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phone:

Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so the micro-SD card is accessible from the outside -- no need to pull the battery to update the card. 

Here's the big things I don't like.

1. You CANNOT use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the micro-sd card as ringtones. 
2. You also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download. Any message (mms) that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper. 
3. Battery life on my phone is flaky - I'm getting maybe a day and one-half with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages.

You must pay Nextel to download ringtones. There are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their micro-SD memory card - however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with.

Note: Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company. If you're making a decision on Sprint vs. Nextel, there are only a couple reasons that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint. First, if the Nextel coverage is better. Second, if you have a need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature.

The Sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications. The Nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrial/construction market. For almost every consumer, the Sprint side is a better deal. Sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives.

Here's my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks:

The Good:

-beautiful speaker phone
-compact design / solid feel
-2 megapixel camera, ability to capture movies
-flip swings open when you push a button
-Nextel sms/mms messages can now be auto-downloaded - I believe this is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature
-nice loud audio
-both Nextel walkie talkie and DirecTalk support

The Bad:
-can't play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other non-Nextel transfer (Note: Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable - but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle)
-Nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier, soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things. While not entirely unexpected, it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to non-construction users (Nextel's core group). If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most Sprint plans which include them. Nextel doesn't have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers. Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens.
-the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to.
-while not phone related, some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals.
-I am only getting about a day of battery life - which is extremely low.


Very well-thought design. I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first. I thought it was weird. But after I looked at the pictures again.. man.. how brilliant! They should've provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on. And the leather is of a very high quality too. The seller is awesome, very Amazon-like shipping (i.e. fast)

This product is definitely worth the $30. The leather is nice and what you can't see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard. When closing the keyboard, the plastic does catch a little, but I think that will go away the more I use it. The phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior. Access to the buttons have been made easy. Each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather. The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating, "ok" and "ptt." The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen. On the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc. Another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clip, however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case. Highly Recommende

I was very happy to see that Amazon shipped me PalmOne brand Stylus's and not some generic.  This is a great deal and I'm going to order some more.  Thank

Does what it needs to... The hell with Palm that changes stylus with every new model

This battery arrived fast, fits, and works well. I highly recommend this seller

Great battery, now the phone goes way longer without needing to be recharged

I ordered this headset in silver - Webtreo sent out white, but said that even though it appears white, it really IS silver! We argued about the color, and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white, silver, red, and black. It took almost a month to get resolved, but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered. It is very small, light, and easy to use. There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit. The headset gets 4 stars, Webtreo only gets 1 star.I wouldn't order any products from them again

This is by far the best bluetooth headset in the market, it is small and very light as well, just like wearing an earing.  The sound is amazingly clear, people on the other end thought I was actually using my phone.  

I have no problem with it falling off, just make sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ear.  I'm so happy with this cutie that I'm buying it for my sisters  friends

Consumer Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as the best. I can hear my callers while driving and they can hear me. The Samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headset, so you won't look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car. 

And if you want to be one of "those" people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places, it's small enough where people will really wonder if you're a crazy person talking to yourself. Gimme a break! The Samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger. This is super handy since the headset is so small and would be easy to lose or damage if not for the sturdy (but not at all bulky) carrying case.

The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headset that I did not quickly return due to poor headset volume. I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my car. I simply could not hear the people to whom I was talking. The Samsung is the first to provide enough volume. I'm still happy with it after two months of ownership.

The Samsung was also approximately $35 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy or other retailers, whether online or in person. So buy it from Amazon's retailers.

The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stay in your ear while running. I learned this one morning when I was late for work and ran from my car to my office. The Samsung quickly began to fall out of my ear.

If the Samsung's short talk time is not a concern for you, then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremely small package

Excellent sound quality.  Noise cancellation really works.  The button on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call.  Very nice.  Works much better and more reliably than ANY BlueTooth set I've tried - and I've tried almost all of them. 

only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easil

I PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS. AND IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.I ALSO WAS VERY PLEASE WITH IT

This case has good quality construction and fits properly. It solves the problem of being able to plug in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case. Two things kept me from rating it 5 stars. I prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses. I also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working. The fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning. This is still the best optional case if you want to use the MP3 player feature and require the use of earphones

  I recently took a chance on this item, and I am happy to report that its not bad!
     I was actually not looking forward to a swivel (bad experience) but the swivel is very solid.

    It looks good. The skin is not the best, but I like it.

    The only problem I have with it is that you have to take out the phone completely in order to use it. 

Works great with my SCH-A950 and BitPim..

It's not rocket science... it works or it doesn't. The device works fine. My only "complaint" is that the cord is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the price. The short cord is the only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating. It's well worth the money

you can tell that the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store.  but it does the job well and i have never had a problem with it

I have nothing but good things to say about this purchase and product.  It works and looks great.  I only wish they could make a PDA phone that wasn't as big as a boat

The battery works very well.  However, the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily

The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster.  How stupid is that?   Why would Samsung supply this type of holster to their customers? 

However, this holster has solved that problem.  You can now flip open your phone when using this holster.  Thank yo

I wasn't expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case, but I'm very impressed.  I bought from accessory one, the total cost was about $4.  The case fits nearly perfectly, every hole is the right size and in the right place, not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case.  Others have complained of chipping paint but in the week I've been using this it hasn't chipped yet.  Can't do any better for the $$$

Very nice, but I don't like the belt clip.  If I remove the belt clip there is still an impediment where it use to be

For the quality and fit of this cover the price is a bargain.  It fits very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grip.  I found the razr v3 to be akward or slippery at times and this cover takes care of that problem.  I would recommend this product highly

If you're looking for a slim cover that won't add a lot of bulk to your RAZR, this one is great. No, it probably WON'T provide much protection if you drop your phone. It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints, and the rubberized material is easy to grip and feels great in your hand. The cutouts for the outside display, camera (I have a V3m), and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well. I don't use the belt clip, as the cover by itself adds hardly any bulk so I just keep my phone in my pocket. Without the belt clip, there is a small 'snap' that sticks out a bit from the back of the cover but it's really no big deal. For the $3, you can't beat this. :-

The battery was everything needed.  No surprises.  It fit the phone and charged fine

I received exactly what I ordered very quickly

Thought I'd post this info here, since this subject still confuses people. I just talked to a cust care representative, who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180-day period will invalidate $250 Amazon phone rebate. 
Well, I guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer, since I don't really need a data plan, and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time. Any comments?

I still would like to give it 5 stars since I believe it is a great product. I'll take one star off however, due for its weak battery life, and lack of standard audio connection (2.5" or 3.5" minijack). 

There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate.  Lots of good features in the 8525.  

My intent is to document some of the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future.  I am a business user who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device. I use a Motorola H700 headset with my old devices and the 8525.

My overall assessment is; Replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I don't think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use.  All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flip phone. 

If readers find that there is a way to perform any of the deficiencies I describe please let me know.  My suggestions in rough order of priority:

1)  Blue tooth headsets. Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting.  To hear my voice commands repeated, I have to turn on the annoying sound of the PDA, so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset, I can hear my voice commands repeated back.  I am referring to the standard voice dial that comes with the 8525.  One quick solution would be to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA.  Even nicer would be an upgrade that allows full audio with the "VoiceCommand" software (this is documented in many other reviews).  Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate.  It changed back to the original audio setting after turning off the BT headset.

1a)  If I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS display the voice dial page.  Instead the initial "Owner Info" page stays up and you can't see the name on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screen.  Not desirable when driving.  If you didn't set the PDA to its annoying noise level you can't hear the name you requested either.

2) Need to be able to control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio, Vibrate or OFF.  For example need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF or vibrate.  

3) Need to be able to program how long the display stays on.  I am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off when I need to see something.  

4) I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if one was available for long drives when my BT headset battery is dead.  Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeway.

5) Provide a built in way to make the PTT and Comm Manager, and IE Quick key buttons programmable.  I would use them for many other functions; such as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker (need to be able to select speaker here see below).

6) Give me a way to press an external button to toggle between speaker on and off.  I can't easily push the speaker icon with my fingers.  Suggestion. Add a radio button on the volume control that allows you to select speaker phone. Yes you can select the phone speaker soft button, but often the display has gone blank and the keypad is showing.  Turning speaker on/off should be easier. 

7) Provide option to save email attachments to storage card.  That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory. 

8) Remember the Filter setting I selected for Tasks.  If I have filtered by a task category during that session remember the filter I selected.   Currently I have so many tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up 

9) Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key (or make this button programmable) I am always having to close the browser because it gets hit/selected

10) Let me Edit/Paste with one step for notes, word, task notes etc.  The IPAQ has "Edit" at the bottom.  With 8525 OS you must select Menu, then Edit, then Copy.  Keep Edit on the bottom. 

Question: is there a key on the keypad to select CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC (the letters are underlined in the menu, but I don't see a CNTRL key on the keypad?

11) Allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the top and then use the nav button to move across the icons (might be the way to allow an external way to set audio volume)

12) If I power off the device have it remember my input selection.  For example I select "Letter Recognizer".  But I must reset each time I power 8525 off.  


I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do. However eventually i found out that the phone part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone. My friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking. The phone ear-volume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places.

Pros:

Software : The windows applications - Word, Excel, Media player. 
           Plus : Ability to create office documents and play games 

Hardware : Micro sd slot - Sandisk card cost me 20 bucks.

Wireless Internet : You could connect this device to any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet. I dont have a data plan with Cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my WIFI home network. If iam at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free.

Cons :

* A bit bulky to carry around.
* Camera is not as expected. The view finder is sloppy and cannot capture images in low light.
* Battery needs to be charged every second day (depends on usage) but even with light use i had to charge it every other day.


Best suitable for :
* Internet savvy people who are on the move.
* Email and messaging.
* As a pocket PC.
* To listen to music (need to purchase micro-sd card)

Accessories:

Boxwave leather case ($30)

Leather case by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device. The only problem is that after you put this case on, the phone volume needs to be set to the max, even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well. But the boxwaver case could be opened half way and folded over.

Bluetooth

This device works very well with blue tooth.

Bottom line:

If you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you. 











This is a wonderful device. Build quality is typical of HTC, meaning very good. The call quality is good provided you're in a decent service area (system not overloaded with AMR-HR kicking in). The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable. The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback. There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult (this is perhaps the ultimate "geek" phone). The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools. There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile, but IMHO it's not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be. In general, things work as they are supposed to with this phone.

One drawback is that while the device does support the Bluetooth A2DP profile (stereo bluetooth sound), the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible. The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono, which means you'll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth. The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality, which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve. And even after all of that, there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio. In other words, don't waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously. However, the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular (mono/one ear) BT headsets (I recommend the Jawbone), and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable.

Another audio related drawback of this device: There is not even a 2.5mm stereo jack. The only physical audio out is through HTC's proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack. The saving grace here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable, and also the availability of HTC-to-3.5mm jack adapters on the market.

Even with a few shortcomings, I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market. It packs an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor. If you're in need of a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices, this is your phone

Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed.  I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several  years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professional-by-day \ GadgetFreak-by-night guy.

If you don't read anything else in my review please understand this:
1)  This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump.
2)  If you are NOT in the market for spending around $110 a month for a service plan (voice and data), you have no business with this phone.

This is a productiviy enhancer, it is not %100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day, this phone does the trick.

The battery life isn't that bad as I have this thing in its cradle (not included) during the day.

Screen is bright.
The WiFi feature works beautifully.
The 3G network is amazingly fast.
Works flawlessly with my Exchange 2003 server.  (Active Sync is so easy to setup, a noob could do it.)

The only reason reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it can't make me a cocktail

This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia (it's quite popular in Singapore), and the HTC TyTN in Europe, but in an unlocked model. and quite a bit more expensive than what Cingular sells it for here.  If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product, you will think it's a heavy, over feature laden product that you will never fully use, and its a problematic one at that.  Having said that, this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today.  The features of this phone (3.5G, Bluetooth 2.0, etc. ) are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with you.  You can even install Skype Mobile on this phone.  The keyboard stows away well, and has good feel.

There were initial problems with this phone in the Asian market, that have now been since resolved, and is now robust and reliable.

But one caveat to keep in mind when using this product...it runs Windows Mobile.  Meaning, if you are not familiar with Windows devices, it may frustrate you...it doesn't respond like a non Windows cell phone.  But, if you can overlook that, it will perform better than anything available...even Blackberry devices do not compare to this

Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brand-new 3G/Wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone.  The 3G and Wi-fi works very well in our area.  It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service.  E-mail and internet works very well in both locations.  Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues, since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette, and use a card reader and USB cable for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips.  The color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone.  Again, 1GB allow you to take a very long video in Windows Media Player format.  Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails, contacts, and calendar any time, any place, and automatically chime schedule notices. The only drawback are the battery life, which require frequent charges, slow keypad for phone calls (and I do not know how to silence the keypad), and a little tough keyboard touch.  Lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult (especially shift+A !).  In addition, Microsoft Word processing is slow, and so as Excel, which will require a faster chip. Overall, a great all-around pocket PC in this generation

I bought my 8525 when they first came out, like two months ago right after christmas
I upgraded to a 2gig memory card and also have the GPS service
I love my phone though it might have problems time to time and some getting used to
Overall this was the best purchase for the price, I ended up spending  almost $900
but I also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and some other features

This is the best phone out. period.
no the iPhone isn't going to beat it
the iPhone doesn't have a slide out keyboard
that's soemthing I don't want to part with
I would like to see the iPhones operating system though!
but the 8525 takes home the trophy!!!

Hi, I just recently purchased this phone. and so far these are the problems. Yes you do have to restart the device, it does get hung, but i don't blame the phone, after all it has windows mobile 5 in it. The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week, So be careful. This phone is pretty close to being perfect. Other than the fact that it has windows, The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have. If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities, Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature.. which in return will give u a nice thick bill.. Once you buy the phone i suggest that  you get this software Spb Pocket plus. It helps shutting down softwares running in the background, and adds more features. The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features. It can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once. Overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware. the one star missing is cause it has Windows. Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too.

Battery came quickly and performs as describe

I bought this cable knowing by reading the reviews that it might not work, so for the price I gave it a shot. This USB cable was a replacement for my other cable that was used as a chew toy by my dog. Since I already had DataPilot (susteen) software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computer with the phone attached it saw it as a (susteen USB cable) and installed all the drivers on winXP, if you don't have susteen drivers/software you can obtain the drivers for the USB cable for your phone from their website (free download). I never used the installation CD that came with this USB cable and I installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes it also works with the DataPilot software, but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830

My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thank you. 

I've had my Tracfone for about 5 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems. Tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. My email is debsclay@gmail.com 
thank you

Very good phone.  Nice color screen.  Easy to read. Lots of features

My experience using the TracFone has been good. Coverage and connections are not a problem

Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things.  This is one better as it has a pen built in.  Just unscrew the tip of the stylus and you've got a pen.  You never know when you'll need one, so when you do there it is.  It also blends in well with the design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactile-ly.  Good stuff

The product came promptly and I am happy with the quality.  However fitment wasn't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo.  Not a huge problem, but something I would feel everytime I reach for the stylus. But the pen works pretty good, and it feels sturdy in my hands.  I would definately recomment this product to others

This is the original and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy.  Fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the V188

ROI is great.  Working very nice for me.  Been using this for the past 2 months.  Fried my original one when used it abroad, with wrong voltage

Excellent price for the charger. Original Motorola equipment.  Shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item.  Shipping was very fast.  I definetly will continue to do business with Amazon and A1 Accessories. Very pleasant and uneventful shopping experience

Kind of difficult to place without getting some kind of stuff between the screen and the protector. Does what it is supposed to do

The price is good and the cable is working well. I had a very good experience with this cable.

I recently bought a Nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones.  However the Nokia CA-53 cable was around 50 dollars.  This was a great alternative.  So far everything that I have used it for is working flawlessly.  I would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the CA-53

This product helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone.I love it to death and use it almost everyday.Eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them

Works fine. Difficult to connect but connects securely. Comes with an unlabeled cd (couldn't tell one side from the other) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers, though the tones aren't labeled in any helpful way. I was impressed. It also has links to any 1st party software you need though I'm sure a Google search would be just as easy

I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect.  The belt clip is very strong, making accidental unclipping rare. The pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts.  The front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets.  The bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the Chocolate's "End" button.  This allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case.  The only dislike I have is the name "Cellnet" embossed on the front flap, but this is not really a big deal.  I would recommend this case to anyone who owns a Chocolate

I've had this case for under a month, but it's working great.  When I first got the case, I thought I was going to have to send it back because I thought it was too small for my phone(I have an LG CU500 from Cingular.).  It was a pretty tight fit, but it worked.  The case has since seemed to stretch a little  so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out

The computer recognizes my phone when I  plug it in, but the drivers on the provided CD are pretty much worthless. 

I needed a Razr Car Charger, and the Crystal Clear Hard Shell Case was included with the purchase.  I did not think I would even use it, but I love it!  It is light weight, easy to clip onto my jeans, and does a great job of protecting my Razr phone!

Cheap. Simple. Good looking.
The only thing missing is a belt clip.  There are stick on belt clips that work fine with this

prompt delivery
excellent quality
a nice bonus - hard shell case! that doesn't ruin Razr's stylish look a single bit

Products exceeded my expectations.  The charger wasn't very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable.  I wasn't interested in the case, but after I got it, I found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal.

This is a nice cellphone.  I got it from a local cellphone shop.  Free and only 1 year contract.  Eventually prices will be free like the motorola Razor V3.  Small phone and I like the mp3 player mode :

This is the best phone I have ever had.  Reception is crystal clear, and it is also a mp3 player, with the ablility to add a memory card. Video, and voice recording capabilities, and a 8x zoom camera. And best of all very, very user friendly. 

I've had this phone for a week. I'm using it with T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary. In my opinion, it's a feature-packed phone at a reasonable price (for an unlocked smart phone, at least). 

The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well, although I did experience some lags and software freezes (with third-party apps). Fixing it was a matter of rebooting. I think the menu organization could be smarter, but you can customize much of it. 

I do love that the default screen displays your day's calendar agenda. But that screen hides the main menu. Not a huge drawback, but it confused me at first.

Photos with the 3-megapixel camera are grainy (it also has a VGA camera). Since this is a phone first, and not a camera, there is also no stabilization control. It does, however, come with a flash.  

Sound quality of phone calls is okay. Your friends, family and colleagues will hear you clearly. On your end, however, it will sound like you're talking on a cell phone. It's not bad, but I've had conversations on better sounding phones.  

I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet (WLAN) access. It's possible to set a default access point. The problem is that if you aren't at that location regularly, you will have to search for a new network. One way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider. I agree, however that some kind of one-button auto-detect would be ideal. 

I don't like the SIM card slot. The metal cover pops off fairly easily -- as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first. 

The phone's slider form factor moves smoothly, perhaps too much so. By default, sliding the phone completely open -- something that's hard, but not impossible to do accidentally -- unlocks the keypad.  

The N-80 is also bit awkward. It feels thick for lack of a better word. Its 5-way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than you'd probably expect. 

Another drawback: no QWERTY keyboard. You can connect to a wireless one via Bluetooth. But that assumes you want to carry a keyboard. The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible. When enabled, it works contextually: on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs.

Overall, I give this phone high marks for features, but a few annoyances mean it's far from The Perfect Phone

I got this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back. Just right off the box, the phone is quite impressive. Many complain about the response time - yes, this phone is slow but doesn't bother me - far better than my windows machine  Overall, very good phone for what it offers. 

Pros:

*	This phone tops in ergonomics, ease of use, presentation, features, Bluetooth, speakerphone and call quality. 
*	Wi-fi is worth mentioning separately. It is simply superb.
*	Nokia's connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market. It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots of money. I accidentally downloaded a big chunk of data and going to pay through my nose next month!
*	All the apps that come with this phone are quite good. 
*	BT sync with my apple is just fine with iSync. Also I transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable from my Wintel. The phone automatically toggles to "Mass storage" mode when it is connected to PC, which is pretty neat. 
*	I haven't faced any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily. I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 2-3 days, good enough for my call volumes. 
*	Symbian browser is fast and stunning. Bookmarks feature is neat. Having the wi-fi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while you're at home and then use it wisely while you are away. 
*	Camera quality is good. Dual camera is just a great idea. Camera settings are similar to professional cameras - very very impressive!
*	Tried the video mode and came fine. 
*	Battery life, as many claim, seems short - but I charge my gadgets daily - so not a big issue
*	The headset that comes with the phone is really good. 
*	Tonnes of themes, apps etc available for this phone..... 

Cons

*	My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed. It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I "selected" an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left. It is SO frustrating.
*	My second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on, the screen light does not come up. So you won't know - even in the day - which button to press to answer the question "Unlock phone?" - you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain. 
*	The process of taking a picture sucks. The picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get. There is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final image. I sincerely hope if there would be some s/w patch for this. I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras - with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i. That is one far superior camera quality I saw so far.
*	Slider lock and unlock feature is good and bad. I am putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket, the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing. So you would need a small app to do the locking properly.

Overall - good phone. At this point, Nokia has better phones like N95 etc - of course very expensive.


I think this is going to be a very good phone, but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800.00 + dollars.
well I called NokiaUSA direct and regular retail from them is 499.00
all day as many as you want, so it should be considerably less on Amazon.
you would think ?
I guess not !


I recieved good customer service and excellent help from these guys.  Thanks for allowing me to keep this phone with my network.  I have so many acessories for this phone. I didn't want to give it up just yet, and you allowed me to get another phone just like the one I had.  Thanks. 

My V180 is through Cingular - I never have a dropped call and reception is excellent. Long Battery life, very easy menus/wayfinding and small size. No frills like MP3 player or camera however - just a very good phone

I've had this phone for a year and a half with no problems.  It is good for making calls which is really all I ask for from a phone.  It is easy enough to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and they've had no problems.  My carrier is Cingular and I've had excellent service in the NY tri-state area and because it is a quad-band phone, I've also been able to use it while roaming internationally.  Battery life is just okay (not as good as my old Nokia)...I have to recharge every other day with normal use.  Overall, it's lasted me long enough that I would call it a good value.   

If you're the type of person that doesn't spend HOURS on the phone, and want a good basic phone, this phone is for you. I bought this phone in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks, and it works great. I would say that the only gripe about this phone in the US is the price, I wouldn't pay over 40 bucks for it. It's a nice BASIC phone. The screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones.

I must admit, I was skeptical about this package. It didn't seem possible that the stuff would actually work for such a low price. Even though shipping was steep, it was still worth the money. The case fits great, and it hasn't cracked at all.  Both chargers work great! I think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it, but I can't complain! I would highly recommend this package. The chargers aren't high quality, but they work

incredible price for all three items. just for the car charger alone, verizon wanted $24.00. the plastic cover for the phone is very good as the razr phone scratches pretty easily

This 3 Piece Combo is a good purchase.  The chargers might feel a little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality.  For the price,  you can not beat it

Helps reduce clutter, and now I can actually close my cup holder tray (Acura RDX)

This charger is awesome.  It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended, it doesn't get in the way like the spiral cords do.  The cord is thin, not bulky.  I never measured the cord when extended, but it is much longer than most

This car charger is amazing for the price. You go to your service provider store and buy a car charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better. The retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular, or sprint stores.

I've had it for about 2 months and I am still happy with it.  It has a little blue led light that comes on when the car is on, which is pretty bright, and could get annoying to some people, but I like it. 

as advertised, on-time...   i've used for two months and it works great...   i'd buy from this outfit again..

I like the way it doesn't take up space in the console when I am not using it and it seems to charge the L6 just fine! No complaints with the devise or the service from Amazon

I'm happy I receive my cable. It fast service. I'll still keep buying from this seller. thank

ive had this charger for the last couple of months, and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it. It is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone

Car charger serves it purpose, it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter.  The design is basic with no hidden features.  You just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way.  
I would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device.  Otherwise a perfect gift!

Excellent qaulity for price. Divers easy to loa

This product has worked great.  The cord is a little short, but have had no functionality issues. 

This was an excellant purchase.  It was exactly what I needed and works as well as one that would have cost me $20 or more in the stores

Not much to say about a battery.  I installed it - it works fine

I purchased this battery becuase my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of service,so it was time. It does last longer and Im glad I bought this battery. I have no bad reviews about this so if you have an audiovox 8910 cell phone and you need an replacement,this is the one.But you decid

This battery performs as expected.
It is the standard Palm battery - meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device. Note also that when using Bluetooth and/or the Blackberry Rim email service battery life is notably reduced.

The solution would be lower device consumption, or a bigger capacity battery - neither of which appear possible at the moment.
So my solution was to have a second spare battery

This product far exceeded my expectations.  It installed very easily with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first day.  It has far out performed and put to shame the more expensive bulkier unit it replaced.  This navigation system is truly a useful tool when traveling in areas you are not familiar with

This is a wonderful cover for your blackberry.
Very sturdy and easy to use. Love it!

I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell, and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch.  It was a great investment.  The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use.  Cosemetically, it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing!  The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards!  This is an excellent product

I used to forget my wallet but I always had my blackberry so I bought this then since I take my phone every where but not my wallet This salved the problem. This is good for people who forget their wallet or phone but remember to bring the other

I love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one. It is just nice to have to keep up with one less thing. I highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff

These are well worth the money for your Nextel Phone!  Although it may not list it, from Experience, these batteries fit 95% of all the Nextel phones.  Take a look at your phone battery to see if it's the same shape.  The color will be different as these have a white cover.  

They are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store.  Plus these were NEVER used before!  Unlike the celluar store battery, these batteries come in a box, with the battery in shrink wrap, so you know the battery has not been used.  When you buy then in the cellular store, they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed (and you'd never know it) plus there is no shrink wrap!  Ever buy a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months?  Hmmm, I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one?  Would you know????

These batteries are well worth it!  Buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days

This charger works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack.  It is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone

This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery.  However, it seems expensive for what you get, not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable.  Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time, save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price...and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges

i couldn't believe how small it is compare to the pictures i saw online. however, one bad thing about that is that i lost it already. now i have to think about buying another one. anyways, it's a cool headset. i would recommand it to anyone who's thinking about buying one.

When I lost my Stylus I had a difficult time finding a replacement. The others I tried weren't the same. These are.

Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phone models: A630, A850, A950, A970, A930, A990, A645, and A870. The thin adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office

I originally bought another Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one. I returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better! It actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer. It's a great product for a great price! Delivery was quick too.

This product is great.  It fits like a glove and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases



Pros:

Fits the phone very snuggly.  Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer.  All buttons of the phone are accessible through the case.  The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and easily remove and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of your waist.

Cons:

You cannot access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case.  The clear plastic screen that covers the phone's screen is a little to far from the surface of the phone's screen.  This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen.  The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but I'm not sure.  

On the positive side, you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online.



Picture quality sucks for the price. Colors are way freaky. The screen is perfect for text but not for pictures. Viewing pictures on this is terrible. Keyboard is ackward at first. The manual needs to be much more detailed. Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots. I expected to use it like a typical pilot, where you write on the screen. This feature is not implemented.  Overall, this is a very good phone. Good reception, great sound quality!! Speakerphone is great! Neat features. Worth the $$

The Treo600 has all the functions I needed -- phone, calendar, camera, etc.  Two shortcomings: 
1) the screen is not good for viewing pictures, but that's what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo650
2) the phone failed to dial two times in two months.  I had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem


   It's a very nice phone!!!!!!

This is a good, thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen. I don't foresee it peeling...ever. It has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare, but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on. I've washed mine, it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky. Just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place. It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bend it, IT WILL NEVER GO BACK. So be extra careful

Durable, thick, doesn't interfere in any way with the touch screen. I haven't had to wash it yet so I haven't tried out that feature. But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these it's been totally worth it to me (hey, after spending hundreds on your Treo what's a few dollars?)

These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.

I had it up and running in minutes with my LG VX-8600 (Verizon).  I downloaded BitPM free software to use with the cable.  I just followed the installation instructions that came on the CD that comes with the cable.
I clicked on "discover phone" in BitPM to have it automatically find the phone.  (I didn't even need to go and look for the com port as the installation says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phone)

Note..
When installing, make sure you pick the right driver.. if you have XP, choose the XP driver, not the NT, or Win98 or other driver.  It's part of the file name..look for XP in the driver file name.  

Received exactly as stated. My only complaint is in the description- they don't state the length of the cable. My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly. I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire, as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall. I projected the cable to be about 6 feet, and if you do yourself, you're in for a surprise. This cable is only about 3 feet long, otherwise everything is fine. One last thing...The description doesn't state this but, the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models, which really helped me.

On a better note, shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated

I have a VX9900 enV and this cable works great with it in conjunction with BitPIM.  Not much to say about it really, it does what it should

got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great, drivers work and everything! awesome deal for 3 bucks :

Works well. Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install. No synchronization software is included so you have to use a third-party tool like bitpim. Which is ok

I ordered this cable on December 1st, got it on the 8th. Very quick.  Brand new.  It came with drivers but I didn't need it because I found drivers online.  The cable fit perfectly with my LGVX9900, and to my surprise it charges too.  I use it to put ringtones on it for free :

I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525, and have had a few problems w/it.  First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt.  Second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest, so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge, I guess I've been really rough on my phone), but I just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge).  But the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it.  When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip, instead I recieved a full refund, so that was a pleasant suprise.  I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone

The K790a is currently the best "Cybershot" camera phone in Sony Ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the U.S. today.  It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones.
